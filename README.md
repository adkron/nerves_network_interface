# NetBasic
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fhunleth/net_basic.ex.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fhunleth/net_basic.ex)

This package enables Elixir applications to configure, get the status of,
and listen to events from LAN and WiFi network interfaces. It is not meant
as a full-featured network interface management library and lacks a majority
of the features available. However, its goal is to support the set of
networking parameters that make sense for end systems in the majority
of home and office environments. This includes:

 * Enumerating available interfaces
 * Reporting when new interfaces appear and disappear (USB WiFi dongle insertion/removal)
 * Querying link-level interface status and statistics
 * Reporting link-level interface status changes
 * Configuring IP addresses, subnets, gateways, etc.
 * Bringing interfaces up and down

Currently only IPv4 is supported. If you use IPv6, I'd be interested in
working with you to integrate IPv6 support.

## Building

This module requires [libmnl](http://netfilter.org/projects/libmnl/) to build.
If you're running a Debian-based system, you can get it by running:

    sudo apt-get install libmnl-dev

If building standalone, just run `make`. The Makefile runs sudo to set the
permissions on the `net_basic` binary, so you'll be asked your password towards
the end. If you do not require additional privileges to modify network
interfaces on your system, you can bypass the calls to sudo by setting the
SUDO environment variable to `true`. I.e., `SUDO=true make`.

To pull in as a dependency to your application, add the following line to your
`mix.exs` deps list:

     {:net_basic, github: "fhunleth/net_basic.ex", branch: "master"}

## Permissions

If an application just needs to get information about LAN interfaces,
this library does not require any additional privileges. If it is necessary
to modify the network interfaces, the same privilege needed to run applications
like `ifconfig` and `ip` will be needed. This can be accomplished by setting
the `net_basic` binary to be setuid root. E.g.,

    chown root:root priv/net_basic
    chmod +s priv/net_basic

Keep in mind that running `setuid` on the net_basic port binary could have
security implications in your system. The `Makefile` will automatically call
`sudo` to do this, but that can be disabled.

## Running

Start `iex`:

    $ iex -S mix

The next step is to create a `NetBasic` process. By default, `NetBasic` creates
a GenEvent process for notifying interface change events, but you can supply one
as an argument to `NetBasic.start_link/1`.

    iex> {:ok, pid} = NetBasic.start_link
    {:ok, #PID<0.82.0>}

To see which interfaces are available, call `NetBasic.interfaces\0`:

    iex> NetBasic.interfaces pid
	['lo', 'eth0', 'wlan0']

To get link-level status information and statistics on an interface, call
`NetBasic.status/2`:

    iex> NetBasic.status(pid, "eth0")
    {:ok, %{ifname: 'eth0', index: 2, is_broadcast: true, is_lower_up: true,
            is_multicast: true, is_running: true, is_up: true,
            mac_address: <<224, 219, 85, 231, 139, 93>>,
            mac_broadcast: <<255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255>>, mtu: 1500, operstate: :up,
            stats: %{collisions: 0, multicast: 7, rx_bytes: 2561254, rx_dropped: 0,
              rx_errors: 0, rx_packets: 5301, tx_bytes: 944159, tx_dropped: 0,
              tx_errors: 0, tx_packets: 3898}, type: :ethernet}

Polling `NetBasic` for status isn't that great, so it's possible to
register a `GenEvent` with `NetBasic`. If you don't supply one in the call
to `start_link`, one is automatically created and available via `NetBasic.event_manager/1`. The
following example shows how to view events at the prompt:

    iex> defmodule Forwarder do
    ...>  use GenEvent
    ...>  def handle_event(event, parent) do
    ...>    send parent, event
    ...>    {:ok, parent}
    ...>  end
    ...> end
    iex> NetBasic.event_manager(pid) |> GenEvent.add_handler(Forwarder, self())
    :ok
    iex> flush
    :ok
    # Plug Ethernet cable in
    iex> flush
    {:net_basic, #PID<0.62.0>, :ifchanged,
     %{ifname: 'eth0', index: 2, is_broadcast: true, is_lower_up: true,
       is_multicast: true, is_running: true, is_up: true,
       mac_address: <<224, 219, 85, 231, 139, 93>>,
       mac_broadcast: <<255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255>>, mtu: 1500, operstate: :up,
       stats: %{collisions: 0, multicast: 14, rx_bytes: 3061718, rx_dropped: 0,
         rx_errors: 0, rx_packets: 7802, tx_bytes: 1273557, tx_dropped: 0,
         tx_errors: 0, tx_packets: 5068}, type: :ethernet}}

Events sent by `NetBasic` include:
  * `ifadded` - an interface was hotplugged (e.g., a USB wifi dongle)
  * `ifrenamed` - an interface was renamed (e.g., `wlan0` is now
    `wlxc83a35ca5f10`
  * `ifchanged - an interface changed statue (e.g., it was down, but now it's
    up)
  * `ifremoved` - an interface was removed (e.g., the user removed a USB wifi
    dongle)

To get the IP configuration for an interface, call `NetBasic.get_configuration/2`:

    iex> NetBasic.get_configuration(pid, "eth0")
    {:ok, %{ipv4_address: '192.168.25.114', ipv4_broadcast: '192.168.25.255',
            ipv4_gateway: '192.168.25.5', ipv4_subnet_mask: '255.255.255.0'}

To setting IP addresses and other configuration, just call
`NetBasic.configure/3` using keyword parameters or a map with what you'd like
to set. The following example uses keyward parameters:

    iex> NetBasic.configure(pid, "eth0", ipv4_address: "192.168.25.200",
    ...> ipv4_subnet_mask: "255.255.255.0")
    :ok

If you get an error, check that you are running Elixir with sufficient privilege
to modify network interfaces or make the `net_basic` binary setuid root.

The library accepts both Erlang strings and Elixir strings. It,
however, only returns Elixir strings.

To enable or disable an interface, you can do so with `NetBasic.ifup/1` and
`NetBasic.ifdown/1`. As you would expect, these require privilege to run:

    iex> NetBasic.ifdown(pid, "eth0")
    :ok
